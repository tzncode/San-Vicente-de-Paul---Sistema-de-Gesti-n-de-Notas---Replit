Development Plan — San Vicente de Paul Academic Grade Management System (Argentina)

I'll include the following features:

Dual Role Authentication System:
Secure username/password login for both Professors and Administrators, with role-based access control and protected session handling.

Professor Dashboard:
Displays assigned courses and subjects, recent exams, pending submissions, and average grades per subject. Tailored to the professor’s teaching level (Primary or Secondary).

Administrator Dashboard:
Overview with global statistics: active courses, subjects, professors, students, and academic performance metrics across the institution.

Course & Subject Management:

Admins can create and organize courses according to the Argentine education system:

Primary Level: 1° to 6° Grado

Secondary Level: 1° to 6° Año

Each course is linked to one or more subjects (e.g., Matemática, Ciencias Sociales, Lengua).

Each subject receives a unique access code for professors to join their corresponding courses.

Professor Enrollment:
Professors can join courses and subjects via admin-generated access codes, filtered by education level (Primaria / Secundaria).
Admins may also assign professors manually when necessary.

Exam Creation Interface:
Professors can create exams within their subjects, defining:

Exam name and optional description

Academic period (Trimestral, Cuatrimestral, Semestral, or Anual)

Associated course and subject

Automatic date of creation and modification tracking
This ensures each exam is tied to the right course structure and reporting period.

Grade Upload System:

Professors can record student grades on a 0.00–10.00 scale (with decimal support).

Includes auto-save, edit-before-submission, and final submission confirmation.

Grades are automatically linked to each student and exam, ensuring consistent data integrity.

Once the academic period closes, further edits are restricted by the admin.

Student Management:
Admins can upload student data in bulk (CSV) or manually, with fields including:

DNI, Full Name, Address, Gender

Responsible Contact (Parent/Guardian name and phone number)

Assigned Course (e.g., 3° Año Secundaria)
Once uploaded, students are automatically associated with all subjects of their course.

Academic Period Configuration:
Admins can define period types (Trimestral, Cuatrimestral, Semestral, Anual) and set start and end dates in months.
Each course and subject aligns with these institution-defined academic cycles.

User Management Panel:
Admins can:

Create, edit, and deactivate professor accounts

Reset or recover passwords

Manage role permissions and access levels

Track login activity for security and auditing

Exam History & Analytics:
Professors and admins can filter exam history by course, subject, academic period, or professor.
Includes performance visualization tools for better academic analysis.

Grade Editing Policy:
Professors can edit grades until the academic period closes.
After closure, only admins can authorize changes, ensuring institutional control.

Data Consistency Rules:

Each subject must belong to one course.

Each course belongs to one education level (Primary or Secondary).

Each professor can belong to multiple subjects/courses, but only within assigned levels.

Clean, Institutional Design:
Simple and professional UI with clear navigation for academic workflows.
Consistent layout for login, dashboards, grade entry, and reports, aligned with typical Argentine school systems.

✅ Notes for Development Consistency

Use “Curso” and “Materia” as base entities — avoid mixing them with “Class” or “Subject” terminology in the codebase.

Define an enum or table for education level (Primaria, Secundaria) and link it directly to courses.

Include DNI as a unique identifier for students (key field).

Define decimal precision (e.g., DECIMAL(4,2)) for grades in the database.

Allow for flexible academic year rollover, so each new cycle can duplicate the existing structure with updated periods.
